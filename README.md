# TDT4252 - Enterprise Architecture for Enterprise Innovation

## Project Overview
This project is part of the **TDT4252 - Enterprise Architecture for Enterprise Innovation** course. The goal of this project is to model and analyze an enterprise using various modeling techniques, specifically **4EM** and **ArchiMate**, to improve operational and strategic aspects. 

The organization chosen for this project is **Start Norge**, a student-driven, non-profit organization that promotes entrepreneurship and innovation among students across Norway. Start Norge operates with a central board and multiple local departments across universities in Norway.

The models created in this project provide insights into Start Norgeâ€™s organizational structure, business processes, goals, and technical systems.

## File Structure
The project contains the following files:

- `4EM.drawio`: The enterprise models created using the **4EM** modeling technique.
- `archimate_models.archimate`: The models created using the **ArchiMate** framework, depicting the enterprise's layers and components.
- `README.md`: This file providing an overview and guidance for the project.

## Using the Models
The models are designed to provide an integrated view of Start Norge's operations. They can be used for:
- **Training New Employees**: New members can use the process models to understand the workflow of content approval and publishing.
- **Strategic Planning**: The central board can use the goal and business rule models to align activities with strategic objectives.
- **Operational Efficiency**: The technical components model helps optimize the use of digital tools and applications, ensuring streamlined processes across departments.

Both **4EM** and **ArchiMate** were used to model the enterprise. While ArchiMate excels in showing the layered relationships between business processes, applications, and technologies, **4EM** provides a more comprehensive view by linking goals, rules, and processes.
